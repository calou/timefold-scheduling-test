  # Solving planning problems with Timefold

  ---

  # What problems are we trying to solve ?

  ### Planning problems:
  - Involves resources
  - Subject to constraints
  - Has a goal to achieve

  ---

  # What is a .... ? (1/2)

  ### Resource
  - Objects or people whose quantity is limited in the context of the problem
  - Examples:
    - employees that can be affected to a shift
    - a room / beamline
    - ...

  ### Constraint
  - a rule that limits/discourage... the use/availability... of a resource
  - Examples:
    - a person can not be at two places at the same time
    - a delivery truck can not be loaded above its maximum capacity
    - ...

  ---

  # What is a .... ? (2/2)

  ### Goal
  - the reason we are solving the problem
  - Examples:
    - Maximize profit...
    - Deliver all packages as fast as possible
    - ...

  # All constraints are not born equal!

  ### Hard constraint
  A constraint that must be satisfied for the solution to be feasible.

  ### Soft constraint
  It would be nice to satisfy soft constraints but they will not affect the feasibility of the solution (only its desirability ).

  # Let's play 

  1- To run the application: 

    ``` shell
        mvn quarkus:dev
    ```

  2 - Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

  3 - Click the `solve` button

  4 - Modify either `TimetableDemoResource` to change the resources or `TimetableConstraintProvider` to change the constraints.

  5 - Reload the page (the app will be automatically rebuilt)

  # Conclusion

  ### Importance of the definitions of the goal(s) and constraints 

  ### Importance of the structure of the models
